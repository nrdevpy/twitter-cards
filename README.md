# Twitter Cards Project

### Overview

This project is a demonstration of building a web application to display Twitter cards using the following technologies:

- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

### Features

- Responsive design that works seamlessly on all devices.
- Dynamic rendering of Twitter cards with user data.
- Clean and maintainable code using TypeScript.
- Fast development and build times with Vite.
- Beautifully styled components with Tailwind CSS.
